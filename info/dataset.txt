Pull all files from dropbox, except for:
    Training-Normal-Videos-Part-2.zip
    Temporal_Anomaly_Annotation_for_Testing_Videos.txt

The end goal is to have the following structure:

ucf_crime/
├─ Test/
│  ├─ Abuse/
│  │  ├─ Abuse001_x264.mp4
│  │  ├─ Abuse002_x264.mp4
│  ├─ Arrest/
│  ├─ .../
├─ Train/
│  ├─ Abuse/
│  │  ├─ Abuse001_x264.mp4
│  │  ├─ Abuse002_x264.mp4/
│  ├─ Arrest/
│  ├─ .../


IMPORTANT: format for normal videos is different then anomaly videos.
Normal videos are stored like Normal_Videos_001_x264.mp4 and RoadAccidents videos are stored as RoadAccidents001_x264.mp4


For standardization, we will limit each class to ~50 videos, and split them off into a train/val/test set accordingly


dataset_maker processes the original dropbox data into a data directory with mp4 format videos
dataset_pruner does a very rudimentary downsampling of unbalanced classes by terminating video samples based on average class counts
dataset_frame_extractor samples videos into frames for training
